Creeate a Kubernetes Cluster with a single pod that has and nginx server
running in a container. The container is configured to be a normal user
without root priveleges.

Without Pod Security Policies:
The user can escalate privelages to run as root.

With Pod Security Policies:
A restrictive PSP should prevent privelege escalation.
A violation of the PSP will prevent the pod from running.

With Envoy:
Envoy is to be used alongside the application that we are testing and
will be used to monitor the inflow and outflow of traffic. With envoy,
we will be able to see how well the implemented pod security policies
are working.
