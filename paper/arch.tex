For this project, we have two Dockerfiles that create docker images that use the Debian Linux distribution
as the base. The \verb|root-debian| image runs as \verb|root| with root privelages by
default, while the \verb|non-root-debian| image runs as \verb|appuser| without root privileges.
These two were built using the \verb|docker-compose| in the \verb|app| directory.

We also created Pod Security Policies to enforce specific rules in the Kubernetes cluster.
