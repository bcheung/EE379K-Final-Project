First, we will improve the base security of the application through Pod Security Policies.
Then we will add another layer of security through Data Plane filters in order to reduce the
attack surface and prevent suspicious activity. These extra layers of security should hopefully
eliminate the vulnerabilities of the application.

\subsection{Without Pod Security Policies}
Both pods successfully deploy and run in the cluster~\ref{no-psp-k8s-resources}. On the 
\verb|non-root-debian| pod, the user can escalate privilages to run as the \verb|root| user ~\ref{no-psp-priv-esc}. 

\subsection{With Pod Security Policies}
% Explain Pod Security Policies
With a restrictive PSP that requires the user to run as a non-root user, the \verb|non-root-debian| 
pod successfully runs while the \verb|root-debian| pod is prevented from running with a 
\verb|CreateContainerConfigError| as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:psp-k8s-resources} and 
Figure~\ref{fig:psp-describe-root}. The PSP prevents the \verb|root-debian| pod from running because
the policies does not allow the pod to run as the \verb|root| user.

The PSP also prevents privilege escalation as well. The \verb|non-root-debian| pod successfully runs
as a non-root user. The same privelege escalation method is tried with this pod after applying PSP,
and as a result, the privilege escalation fails as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:psp-priv-esc}.

\subsection{Network Proxy - Envoy}
We demonstrate just some of the features of Envoy, including the ability to secure HTTP traffic by applying SSL
certificates and redirecting HTTP to HTTPS traffic as well using Envoy's External authorization filter
used with Open Policy Agent to enforce security policies over API requests that the proxy receives.

\subsubsection{SSL Certificate and HTTPS Redirect}
In order to apply SSL certificates to a request and redirect traffic to HTTPS, first a SSL certificate needs to be created.
Ideally, you would generate the certificate from some service, but a simple certificate can be generated using the following command
\begin{minted}{bash}
  mkdir certificates;
  cd certificates;
  openssl req - nodes -new -x509 \
    -keyout "domainname-com.key -out domainname-com.crt \
    -days 365 \
    -subj '/CN=domainname.com/O=Company Name LTD./C=US';
\end{minted}
After creating the SSL certificate, the envoy.yaml file needs to be edited in order to apply a TLS context in the filter.
A TLS context will specify the certificate(s) to be used with the proxy domains. The following lines will apply the TLS context
\begin{minted}{yaml}
  tls_context:
     common_tls_context:
     tls_certificates:
        - certificate_chain:
           filename: "/filepath_to_certificate.crt"
        private_key:
           filname: "/filepath_to_certificate.key"
\end{minted}
After defining the certificates to be used, the proxy will be able to redirect traffic to HTTPS. In order to complete the
redirect, we need to set the https_redirect flag to true.
\begin{minted}{yaml}
  redirect:
     path_redirect: "/"
     https_redirect: true    
\end{minted}

\subsubsection{Envoy Proxy Configuration with OPA}
In this section, we examine envoy's ability to use external authorization services, specifically checking
if incoming requests have certain authorization privileges. In this example, we have to clients, Brian and Sam, that
want to access an endpoint that has employees. Brian is assigned a guest role, and thus can only execute a GET request to
the endpoint but can't
