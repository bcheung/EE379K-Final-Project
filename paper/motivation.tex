It is important to continue iterating upon known attacks and ways to improve security measures to better defend the inherent vulnerabilities within applications and cloud services and
counter intentional malicious attacks. With the increasing popularity of Kubernetes and pod deployment, there comes a need to understand how to reinforce the security of these pods that
applications will be deployed on. Additionally, understanding how to effectively use a network proxy to filter out requests and to better protect services and even clients, is important,
especially with how popular cloud services are becoming. Knowing how to implement a strong initial network filter that can effectively identifies a majority of attacks dramatically decreases 
the chance of a successful attack. If most of the attempted attacks are initially thwarted, there are few attacks that can get through the security in place. A good network filter means less
attacks an application has to be wary of, which should lead to a higher defense rate.
