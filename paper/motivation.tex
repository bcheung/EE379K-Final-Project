It is important to continue iterating upon known threats and ways to improve security measures to 
better defend the inherent vulnerabilities within applications and cloud services and counter 
intentional malicious attacks. With the increasing popularity of distributed applications deployed 
with container orchestration technologies like Kubernetes,  there comes a need to understand how 
to reinforce the security of these pods that applications will be deployed on. Additionally, we 
must consider additional layers of security, which depend on the type of application and its exposure 
to other services. In this case we examine the need for securing the application's network 
communications through a network proxy to filter out requests and to better protect clients and services. 
Knowing how to implement a strong initial network filter that can effectively identify a majority of 
attacks dramatically decreases the chance of attackers successfully compromising the system. If most of 
the attempted attacks are initially thwarted, there are few attacks that can get through the security in 
place. Again, this results in a smaller attack surface.
