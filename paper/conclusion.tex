While Pod Security Policies and Network Proxies have similar goals of maintaining/strengthening the strength of the
security of an application, they do have different use cases and have unique strengths when it comes to application/network security.
As mentioned, a network proxy is the middleman between the client and the network and thus is met with every network request.
Thus, designing a network proxy that can effectively handle these network requests, whether that be filtering out malicious requests, or
assigning security policies onto API requests is extremely important in protecting the overall security integrity of the application
as well as reducing the load that the rest of the application has to deal with. Implementing Pod Security Policies is important because
it protects what the application is actually deployed on.
