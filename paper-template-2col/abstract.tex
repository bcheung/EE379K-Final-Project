We will examine the vulnerabilities of a distributed application without using
any layers of security. Then we will implement Pod Security Policies and Data Plane Filters
to imporve the security of the application itself and filter out suspicious network traffic.
The filtering of certain packets based on information such as the source/destination
IP addresses and protocols can further reduce the attack surface and strengthen current security practices
for applications. Through our research, we hope that the implementation of filtering
out network traffic will lead to an increase in security performance.
