the proposed experiments and what you aim to find out.

We will be examining how better use of Pod Security Policy and/or Data Plane Filters to filter out network traffic can improve security of an application.
This idea of filtering out certain packets based on information like their source/destination IP and protocols can be used to further optimize and strengthen current security practices
for applications. Through our research, we hope that the implementation of filtering out network traffic will lead to an increase in security performance.
