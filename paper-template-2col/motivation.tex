It is important to continue researching how network filtering can lead to better application security, especially with a lot of technologies and applications all moving into the cloud.
A strong initial filter that effectively identifies a majority of attacks dramatically decreases the chance of a successful attack. If most of the attempted attacks are initially thwarted,
there are few attacks that can get through the security in place. A good network filter means less attacks an application has to be wary of, which should lead to a higher defense rate.
